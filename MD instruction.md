# Instruction for Markdown

## Text highlighting

For coursive you should frame text with asterisks or using underscores. *For example* or _For example_.

We need alternatives because we could work with bold AND coursive at the same time.
_**For example**_

For bold text you should frame it with double asterisks. **For example**.

## Lists

For spotting numerous list type (*) or +
For adding not numerous lists you should type points. For example:
* Element 1
* Element 2
* Element 3
+ Element 4

For adding numerous lists just type numbers. For example:
1. First paragraph
2. Second paragraph
3. Third paragraph


## Work with images

![Hey! It's a random cat!](IMG_3373.jpeg)

## Remote repository

Algo to work with remote repositories:

1. 'Fork' a repository you are interested in
2. 'Git clone' for our local version of the repository
3. Create a branch with all suggested changes
4. Do all changes exactly in this branch
5. 'Push' for sending our version to CitHub (it will be our account)
6. There will be an ability to click 'Pull request'
